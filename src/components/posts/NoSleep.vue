			This has not been a great week for sleep. Although I usually
			wake up throughout the night, recently I've been up for 
			hours at a time. Waking up at 2am and staying up until
			morning. As far as I can tell, nothing in my routine
			has changed, and I feel fine otherwise.

			I have to acknowledge the two year cycle of a certain pattern.
			In January 2020 and 2022, I experience a certain kind of shock.
			I'm not ready to write about it just yet. But the pattern of 
			behavior begain with a series of sleepless nights. I have tools
			to keep this spiraling out of control, but I can't deny that
			it's on my mind.

			I think it's important that I share my concerns with Melissa. I'm
			not sure she'll totally understand, but I know she will be supportive.
			Don't feel like I have much more to say at the moment. Time to go
			to the gym, and get ready for Xel-Ha
