		A personal site for journaling, putting thoughts to paper (so to speak).
		I'm told that writing is a good habit to develop, that it's healthy to
		get your thoughts out. I tend to do a lot of thinking. Not necessarily
		very insightful or deep. Just a lot of thinking.
		</p>
		<p>
		I had been kicking around the idea of a personal site for a while,
		for a number of reasons. 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				It seems standard practice to developers to
				have a site to present their portfolio, contact info, demonstrate a general
				interest in software development, to act as a type of digital business card
				for potential employers.
			</li>
			<li>
				It would be nice to have a personal workspace to play around with development
				outside of the day job. Just getting to work on something different and a good
				medium for continuous learning. I tend to be focused on this quite a lot, because I
				have a chip on my shoulder about not having a formal education in software development.
			</li>
			<li>
				I had decided to start journaling again to hopefully get some thoughts out and clear my head.
				I had played around with journaling in the past but the habit never stuck. I've read it's a good
				habit to get in to, and lately I've been concerned with cultivating every good habit I can.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Ultimately, the desire to get my thoughts out was the tipping point in the creation of
			this site. Writing in a notebook didn't stick, and I'm not likely to go back and read any of it,
			even if I could (my handwriting is terrible). I don't take great
			pleasure in the physical act of writing, as much as I do typing. And given that I work as a web developer,
			and had been playing around with the idea of personal site, it made sense to use a site as a medium to get
			ideas out.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, I regularly wake up in the middle of the night with an extremely active mind. So I'm hoping that
			writing will help get some thoughts out, tire the mind, force some introspection, and ultimately help
			quiet things a bit.
		</p>

			It's 5:15 am on Friday, January 5th, 2024, and I've been up since 2:30 am. So perhaps time to sign off and
			hopefully find some rest before work tomorrow. At least its friday.
